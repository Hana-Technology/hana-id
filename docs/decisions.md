# Decision log

One entry per decision: what was decided, when, why, what was rejected, its status, and where it is written down.
Last verified against code: 2026-10-28 (commit 58edee9).

Consolidated from `docs/context.md` ("Decisions", "Batch A.2 decisions", "Batch C decisions", "Testnet
measurements"), `docs/batch-a-spec.md` ("Decisions"), `docs/batch-a2-shared-client.md`, `docs/batch-b-spec.md`
("Decisions", "Confirmed by the user", answered questions) and decisions made in conversation with the user that were
not yet written down (source "conversation"). Dates marked "≤ 2026-10-26" come from the design conversation in
wend-widget-demo, before the repo existed. Status: **in force** (in the code), **confirmed** (decided, code in
progress or not started), **deferred**, **superseded**, **proposed** (in a draft spec, not confirmed).

## Product and scope

### D1. Name: Hana ID, repo `hana-id`, npm scope `@hana-id`
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force (scope still to claim on npm) · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"
- Why: `@hana` is taken on npm; `@hana-id` looked free.
- Rejected: `@hana`.

### D2. Target a production MVP: real users and real funds on mainnet
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"; CLAUDE.md
- Decision: production standards and tests for every behaviour from the start. Path: testnet pilot (batches A, A.2,
  B and a testnet smoke test), then production MVP (final accounts and address freeze, external audit, upgrade
  governance, mainnet MPC, key export and rotation, monitoring, legal and Google brand verification).
- Rejected: a throwaway prototype.

### D3. Any app can integrate; Sodax is the first customer, not a special case
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force (`@hana-id/sodax`: Stellar and EVM wallet-provider adapters) · Source:
  `docs/context.md` "Decisions"
- Decision: nothing customer-specific. The core SDK exposes standard interfaces (EIP-1193, Stellar Wallets Kit, raw
  sign); Sodax gets a thin optional adapter (`@hana-id/sodax`, `IStellarWalletProvider`). Pilot wallets on
  testnet-MPC keys are disposable.

### D4. Email login later, as its own trust decision
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: deferred · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"; `docs/batch-a-spec.md`
- Why: whoever signs email tokens can derive any email user's key. Batch A made the verifier provider-generic
  (`issuers.rs`) so email can be another issuer.

### D5. Throwaway accounts first; every account name in `envs/<env>.json`
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"; `docs/batch-a-spec.md`
- Decision: no `*.testnet` name hard-coded outside manifests and tests (`packages/env`).
- Why: accounts are replaced before the address freeze; one manifest per env keeps code env-free.

### D6. NEAR account keys use ed25519, not ml-dsa-65
- Date 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: conversation
- Decision: owner, signer and relayer full-access keys and every function-call key are ed25519.
- Why: post-quantum support in NEAR tooling is too new for now.
- Rejected: ml-dsa-65.

## Keys and derivation

### D7. CKD only; no per-transaction MPC signing
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/batch-a-spec.md` "Decisions"; `docs/context.md`
- Decision: the MPC derives a key per user once per login (CKD, domain 2); signing is local in the browser.
- Why: one MPC call per login instead of per signature; local signing takes ~0.25 ms.
- Rejected (removed in batch A): `sign_with_session`, `sign`, `on_verified`, `sign_target`, envelopes, the NEAR
  Auth/FastAuth router and per-chain MPC signing code.

### D8. `key_index` in the path, for rotation after a leak
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26; bound added 2026-10-27 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/batch-a-spec.md`; `docs/batch-b-spec.md`
  "Key rotation hooks"
- Decision: path = `{scope_id}#{provider}#{sub}#{key_index}`. The MVP uses 0 and partners can't set it.
  `key_index ≥ 2^31` is reserved and refused by the contract, API and SDK.
- Not built: the rotation flow itself.

### D9. Derivation v1: `hana-id/chain-keys/v1/extract` and `/expand`, no global recovery phrase
- Date 2026-10-28 (names and structure confirmed by the user; Q36) · Status: in force (`packages/core/src/derivation.ts`)
  · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user", "Derivation v1"
- Decision: one HKDF-Extract of S to PRK, then HKDF-Expand per `(namespace, curve, account)`; tuples
  `("stellar","ed25519")` and `("eip155","secp256k1")`; EVM key by FIPS 186-5 A.2.1 reduction of 48 bytes; export is
  a raw key per chain. Golden vectors and a guard test. This changed every provisional address (allowed before the
  freeze).
- Why: additive for new chains and accounts; the two suffixes make a salt/info swap impossible to miss.
- Rejected: the provisional one-shot HKDF with salt `hana-embed-ckd-v1`; a BIP-39 phrase; keeping S in the vault
  (R7: PRK only).

## Registry and isolation

### D10. Per-partner scope from the token's `(provider, aud)`, via a registry inside `hana-signer`
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"; `docs/batch-a-spec.md`
- Decision: each partner app is a scope; the scope is part of the path, so one app can't derive another app's
  users' keys. A scope may hold several client IDs (web, iOS, Android). The registry is a module of `hana-signer`
  (`registry.rs`).
- Why: the PoC's global client-ID list let any listed app derive every user's key.
- Rejected: a global client list; a separate registry contract.

### D11. Self-serve-ready registry, closed for the pilot
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"; `docs/batch-a-spec.md`
- Decision: `public_registration` is off and one-way; while off, Hana registers scopes (`admin_register_scope`).
  Client ownership is proven by a token for that client; adding clients and changing owners is owner-only and
  timelocked. Owners are NEAR accounts or Google identities. Hana can't move clients; suspension is API-side only.
- Why: self-serve needs client-ownership proofs that hold up; they prove less than they seem (see the contract's
  security notes).
- Amended by D12: Hana can stop logins to a shared-only scope by removing shared clients.

### D12. Shared Google client mode
- Date 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch A.2 decisions"; `docs/batch-a2-shared-client.md`
- Decision: besides its own client, an app can log in through Hana's shared clients (`sharedGoogleClientIds`,
  `set_shared_clients`, ≤ 5). The scope then comes from the session nonce, which commits to `scope_id`; the scope must
  have `allow_shared`. A client is shared or a scope's own, never both. Adding a shared client and enabling
  `allow_shared` are timelocked; removing and `disable_shared_login` are immediate.
- Why: partners can start without their own OAuth client (like Privy's default credentials) and keep per-app
  isolation. Forging a nonce only gets the forger their own key. The path has no client ID, so own and shared logins
  give the same address (Google `sub` confirmed stable across one project's clients, 2026-10-27, and across Cloud
  projects, 2026-10-28: D42).

### D13. Retired shared clients can never join a scope
- Date 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch A.2 decisions"
- Why: anyone able to load Hana's login page could mint tokens for a retired client with a nonce of their choosing.

### D14. Every nonce commits to the signer account; layouts checked twice
- Date 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch A.2 decisions"; `docs/contract-interface.md`
- Decision: all nonces start with borsh(signer account id); the session nonce also commits to `scope_id` and
  `max_uses`; session messages are `"hana-id-session-v1:" ‖ counter ‖ sha256(payload)`. Layouts are checked against an
  independent JS implementation (`gen-fixtures.mjs`) and in the sandbox.
- Why: no token replay across deployments; a front-runner can't change the scope or use cap.

### D15. Fresh deploy for A.2; batch B is a code upgrade
- Date 2026-10-26 (A.2), 2026-10-27 (B) · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch A.2 decisions";
  `docs/contract-interface.md` "Changed in batch B"
- Why: A.2 changed the state layout; B changed no layout, path or state.

## Infrastructure and API

### D16. App config off-chain in D1; API on Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects
- Date ≤ 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Decisions"; `docs/batch-a-spec.md`
- Decision: publishable keys, origins, plans, suspension, usage in D1; one Durable Object per relayer key serialises
  nonces.
- Why: built-in DDoS and rate limiting, a free tier, no database credentials.

### D17. Stay on Cloudflare (Workers + DO + D1)
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch C decisions" (plan doc review); conversation
- Decision: kept after comparing alternatives on security and cost for a cost-sensitive startup.
- Why: cheapest at every volume, DDoS included, no OS to patch, Durable Objects fit the nonce design. Infra is under
  1% of running cost; NEAR gas (~38–40 Tgas, ~$0.02 per login) is the bill, so the lever is fewer on-chain calls per
  login.
- Later: AWS KMS only for HSM-grade keys (email issuer). Revisit at D1 ~5 GB, an HSM or region requirement, or
  ~500 req/s per app.

### D18. No production env or Hana custom domain while in development; sandbox-dev on workers.dev
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: deferred · Source: conversation; `docs/context.md` (latency notes)
- Decision: sandbox-dev runs on `*.tingtc.workers.dev` (personal account, free plan). The production env, a
  Hana-owned domain and Cloudflare account come later.
- Why: free-plan routing from Malaysia scatters requests to US/EU colos (also seen on a free custom zone); whether a
  paid zone fixes it can only be tested once a Hana domain exists, so that test is deferred too.

### D19. Two relayer key pools
- Date 2026-10-26 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch A.2 decisions"
- Decision: session pool (`RELAYER_KEYS`) and owner pool (`OWNER_RELAYER_KEYS`, small allowance), separate keys and
  Durable Objects, per-method gas. `deploy-contract` treats a wrong receiver, wrong or empty methods, or an unlimited
  or too-large allowance as a blocker.
- Why: abuse of `/v1/owner-actions` can't stop logins.

### D20. The API verifies before relaying
- Date 2026-10-26; derive precheck 2026-10-27 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch A.2 decisions",
  "Testnet measurements" (`fix/derive-precheck`)
- Decision: RS256, claims and nonce for sessions; Ed25519 session signatures; the scope check;
  `session_key_in_use`; and the contract's counter and `max_uses` rules mirrored off-chain (409 `counter_used`,
  `session_exhausted`, `counter_out_of_range`).
- Why: every relayed transaction is paid even when it fails (~2.2 Tgas for a rejected derive), and signed requests
  are public on chain, so anyone could replay them at Hana's cost.

### D21. Relayer latency design
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/context.md` "Testnet measurements" (`perf/api-latency`,
  `perf/relay-dispatch`, `perf/relayer-cold-start`)
- Decision: answer at `EXECUTED_OPTIMISTIC`, not finality; run independent chain reads in parallel; reserve nonces 100
  at a time (one confirmed write per 100 relays, a restart skips ≤ 99); cold starts trust the stored reservation and
  block hash (< 5 min) with no chain read; pin shared Durable Objects with a location hint (sandbox-dev `apac`).
- Why: measured on testnet: the per-tx nonce write held every broadcast behind its storage confirmation, and idle
  objects (evicted after ~10 s) read the chain on every cold start.

## Batch B (SDK), confirmed by the user

### D22. Keep the wallet across reloads with a server-held share
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: in force (`apps/api/src/vault/`, `packages/web/src/vault/`) ·
  Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user", "Key persistence"
- Decision: per-app `persistence: 'session' | 'none'` (default `'session'`). In `'session'` mode the session has
  `max_uses = 1`; the browser stores PRK encrypted under `K_s`; the API returns `K_s` only for a signed, in-order,
  unexpired, unrevoked share request. Idle and absolute limits, revoke and revoke-all.
- Why: a Privy-like experience; and a reload costs nothing on chain instead of ~$0.02 and 6–9 s.
- Rejected: local AES-GCM of S with a session key that still has uses (R5: `derive_key` is permissionless, so the
  server limits would be bypassable on chain).

### D23. Approval popup by default; opt-in auto-approve policies
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: in force (`packages/core/src/policy/`, `packages/web/src/vault/`) ·
  Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user", "Auto-approve policies"
- Decision: every signature needs a guarded Approve in a Hana popup unless it matches a policy the app owner set
  (delayed) and the user accepted (bound to `policyId`). Off by default; two opt-ins. Batch B covers typed calls only
  (direct calls with typed address arguments, token approvals to listed contracts, listed Stellar `changeTrust`).
  Raw signing, `personal_sign`, `stellar_signMessage` and contract creation are never covered.
- Why: Privy offers a confirmation toggle and delegated-action policies; this is the equivalent without a
  server-side signer (the key exists only in the vault).
- Rejected: "partners can't turn approval off"; server-side delegated signing.

### D24. No protocol decoder in batch B; Sodax uses the popup
- Date 2026-10-27 (Q42) · Status: in force (empty decoder registry, `packages/core/src/policy/decoders.ts`) · Source:
  `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Sodax needs a protocol decoder", Q42
- Decision: Sodax spoke calls carry intents in opaque bytes on EVM and Stellar, so no policy can check them. Batch B
  ships the `ProtocolDecoder` interface with an empty registry; a `sodax-intent-v1` decoder comes later on demand.
  `AssetManager.transfer`, `Connection.sendMessage` and `send_message` may never have `addressArgs: 'any'`.
- Why: an arbitrary `data` on a tiny deposit could empty the user's hub wallet; value limits don't bound that.

### D25. Google Workspace accounts are allowed; openid-only tokens
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed, in force (`apps/api/src/claims.ts`, `packages/core/src/id-token.ts`) · Source:
  conversation; `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user", Q1, Q32
- Decision: Workspace users log in normally. The claim allow-list stays as a guard against Google adding claims.
- Why: the spike (`apps/smoke/spike.html`, Chrome) showed `scope=openid` tokens for both a personal and a Workspace
  account carry exactly `{aud, azp, exp, iat, iss, jti, nbf, nonce, sub}`: no `hd`, email, name or picture. So
  blocking Workspace accounts is neither possible nor needed, and no domain or PII reaches the chain.
- Rejected: refusing tokens with `hd` (the spec's earlier position, which would have blocked Workspace users).

### D26. One transaction per login, with a ship gate
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed; contract, API and vault in force, not yet measured on testnet · Source:
  `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user"; `docs/contract-interface.md`
- Decision: `create_session_and_derive`, a literal composition of `create_session` and `derive_key` with counter 1,
  through `POST /v1/login`. If the 10-run testnet median saves less than 1.5 s, the method is removed before the
  audit and the split flow stays.
- Why: measured ~2 s of the ~8.9 s login is the second transaction.

### D27. Export proves freshness by a new login, not `auth_time`
- Date 2026-10-28 (Q33, spike) · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/auth/export-page.ts`) · Source:
  `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q33
- Decision: export runs its own fresh login plus a typed confirmation; the `auth_time` check is off
  (`maxAuthAgeMs` unset, `packages/core/src/id-token.ts`).
- Why: with `max_age=0` Google returned no `auth_time`.

### D35. Message, typed-data and raw approvals bind no network; the popup says so
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/core/src/approval.ts`, `packages/web/src/auth/render-approval.ts`) ·
  Source: conversation (decided by the user); `docs/security.md` (k)
- Decision: the approval digest's `contextString` is the passphrase for Stellar transactions and auth entries, the
  chain ID for EVM transactions, and empty for `stellar_signMessage`, `personal_sign`, `eth_signTypedData_v4` and
  `hana_signRaw`. The approve popup shows "This signature isn't tied to one network." on message and raw requests;
  typed data shows its domain's chain (or warns that it names none).
- Why: these requests name no network of their own, and the vault never learns the dapp's selected EVM chain (the
  SDK answers `eth_chainId`), so there is nothing true to bind; showing a chain the signature isn't limited to would
  mislead.
- Rejected: binding the SDK's current chain (the vault can't verify it, and the signature is valid on every chain
  anyway).

### D36. The Approve guard arms per input type
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/auth/approve-guard.ts`) · Source: conversation (decided by
  the user); amends `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Approval flow" step 5
- Decision: Approve and Allow stay disabled until 1 s after the request rendered, 1 s after the window last gained
  focus or became visible, and an arming gesture after both. Mouse: only a `pointermove` that moved arms (a press
  never does, and zero-movement synthetic moves are ignored). Touch and pen: a `pointerdown` arms. Keyboard: only
  Tab, Shift+Tab and the arrow keys arm; Enter, Space and auto-repeated keys never do. The arming gesture never
  approves: Approve acts only on a click whose own pointerdown (or non-repeated keydown) came after it. The page never
  focuses Approve.
- Amended 2026-10-28: a mouse move "moved" when its `movementX`/`movementY` is non-zero or, when
  both are 0, when **both** its client position and its screen position differ from the last pointer event's (move or
  press) recorded in the current request and focus period; every reset of the guard (a new request, a focus, a blur,
  nothing to approve) forgets that position, and missing or non-finite coordinates never arm. WebKit reports 0
  movement on every `pointermove` (found by the Playwright suite: Approve never armed in WebKit, so Safari mouse users
  could not approve). A real cursor move changes both positions; a layout change under a still cursor changes
  neither; a window move changes only the screen position; so neither of the last two arms, nor does the first
  zero-movement move (nothing to compare with). Hardened after a security review of the first version, which compared
  client coordinates only and kept the position across requests.
- Amended 2026-10-29: the screen position is no longer compared, only the client position (still reset on every
  guard reset). WebKit on Linux (CI) reports fixed screen coordinates, so Approve never armed there. The client
  position is what separates the threat: a layout change or scroll under a still cursor leaves it unchanged; it changes
  only when the cursor moves or the user moves the window under it (no other page can move the popup). The earlier
  note that a window move changes only the screen position was backwards.
- Why: the spec's `pointermove`-only rule never arms on a stationary tap or from the keyboard, so phone and
  keyboard-only users could not approve. Keeping mouse on `pointermove` means clicking in place never approves, and
  keeping Enter and Space out means a held key never approves.
- Residual risk (accepted): on a phone, someone tapping repeatedly for more than 1 s after the popup tab opens can
  still approve in two taps, if the second lands on Approve.
- Rejected: `pointermove` only (unusable on touch and keyboard); any `pointerdown` or `keydown` arming (the deviation
  first coded in `fbdb0ce`: mouse click-spam or a held Enter could approve in two events).

### D37. Auto-approve: fees count as spend; opaque arguments always need a decoder
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/core/src/policy/`) · Source: conversation
  (security findings (b)–(d), `docs/security.md` "Known open issues")
- Decision: on EVM, `value + maximum fee` counts against `maxValueWei` and `maxValueWeiPerDay` and is recorded as the
  day's spend (`maxFeeWei` still caps the fee alone). Arguments the address rule can't see into (`bytes`, `string`,
  `bytes20`+, exactly-160-bit integers; Soroban `Bytes`/`BytesN`/`String`) are never auto-approved under either
  `addressArgs` rule: such functions need a protocol decoder. `'any'` is also refused on execute/multicall-style
  names. Wider integers stay allowed as amounts.
- Why: the SDK fills gas and fees on the partner page, so an injected script could burn the native balance in fees on
  top of the value limit; under `'any'` a multicall or an `execute(…, bytes)` could carry a transfer to any address;
  a `uint160` is an address in integer form.
- Rejected: treating `uint256` as opaque (it is every amount); a validator check on Stellar argument types (a Stellar
  policy names functions only; the matcher checks each request instead).
- Consequences: a policy with `maxValueWei: "0"` no longer auto-approves EVM transactions; Permit2 typed data and
  Uniswap v3 calls (`uint160` fields) always get the popup until a decoder covers them.

## Batch C (dashboard), decided 2026-10-27

The batch C spec (`docs/batch-c-spec.md`) is a draft; only the entries below were decided with the user.

### D28. A developer dashboard like Privy's
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: confirmed, not built · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch C decisions"
- Decision: partners manage orgs, members, apps, origins, keys and on-chain owner actions (`/v1/owner-actions` with a
  console-client token). Replaces `admin app:*` after the pilot.

### D29. Invite-only sign-up
- Date 2026-10-27, reconfirmed 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed, not built · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch C
  decisions"; conversation
- Decision: no public sign-up. A Hana admin issues email-bound, single-use, expiring invites (stored hashed); sign-in
  with Google through the console client; no accepted invite means refused. `public_registration` stays off.

### D30. Separate Hana admin console behind Cloudflare Access; billing-grade usage in D1
- Date 2026-10-27 · Status: confirmed, not built · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch C decisions"
- Decision: contract-billing reports per org and app by day and month (logins, derives, MAU, new users, gas and USD,
  failures, latency), CSV statements. Billing-grade totals in D1; Analytics Engine (3 months) for operational metrics
  only.

### D31. Billing on hold; Sodax billed by service contract
- Date 2026-10-27, reconfirmed 2026-10-28 · Status: deferred · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch C decisions";
  conversation
- Decision: no Stripe, plans or invoicing yet. Sodax is billed under its service contract from the monthly statement.

### D32. Allowed origins are security-critical in shared-login mode
- Date 2026-10-27; delay set 2026-10-28 (D34) · Status: confirmed, not built · Source: `docs/context.md` "Batch C
  decisions"
- Decision: origin changes need a fresh sign-in, are logged and email the other owners; they take effect after 24 h
  and can be cancelled meanwhile (D34).
- Why: in shared mode, origins decide which pages may embed the vault and get nonces for the scope.

## Pre-mainnet and batch C scope, decided 2026-10-28

### D33. Bound issuer-key and upgrade power before mainnet
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user, to spec as a pre-mainnet batch · Source: `docs/security.md` open issue (e)
- Decision: a newly posted issuer key becomes usable only after a delay, during which an independent watchdog (own
  key, own service, checks Google's published JWKS) can cancel it; alert on any `issuer_key_set` for a kid Google
  doesn't publish; the owner account becomes a multisig; the signer account's full-access key is removed and
  upgrades go only through the owner multisig with a timelock and public notice. Later, optionally, k-of-n
  independent key posters.
- Why: today `KEYS_UPDATER_KEY` (a Worker secret), the owner account or the signer's full-access key can each forge
  Google tokens or swap the contract and so derive any user's key.
- Open: the delay length. Measure Google's key lead time first (record when each kid first appears in the JWKS);
  the watchdog may approve early when the key matches Google's list. No address change.

### D34. Batch C MVP cut
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user · Source: batch C MVP trim proposal (to be folded into
  `docs/batch-c-spec.md`)
- Decision: keep three Workers and three D1s, the script-free auth origin, the server-side Google code flow,
  invite-only sign-up, origin safety (change-bound token, 24 h delay, notice, cancel), the on-chain watcher,
  settlement at FINAL, uid HMAC for MAU and the admin billing reports. Add the auto-approve policy editor (same path
  as origin changes; removal immediate). Simplify: two roles (owner, viewer), one fail-closed notice channel from the
  admin Worker, direct usage inserts with a daily nonce cross-check, on-demand reports with frozen monthly
  statements, compare-and-swap writes instead of the reconciler, publishable keys with a fixed 24 h grace. Defer:
  mandatory passkeys (required before a second partner joins), second-owner approval, Hana restore of revoked keys
  and removed origins, the partner app-request queue, secret keys, R2/AE copies, Stripe.
- Why: about 40% of the draft's size with every security property kept or its loss stated.
- Blocked on: a Hana Cloudflare account and zone, an email provider, Cloudflare Access with MFA.

### D38. Vault and auth popups on two registrable domains
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user; domain names not chosen · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Origins
  and pages", `docs/security.md` (j)
- Decision: production `vaultOrigin` and `authOrigin` sit on different registrable domains. The auth domain is the only
  one users see (popup address bar), so it is an official, recognisable Hana domain; whether that is `hanawallet.io` or
  another domain is undecided. The vault domain is never shown and hosts nothing else.
- Why: desktop Chrome/Edge/Firefox guarantee separate processes per site, so content shown in the popups can't share a
  process with the vault's PRK. Costs one extra domain (~$12/yr); no code change, the schema already refuses a
  same-site pair outside `local*`/`sandbox*` envs.
- Rejected: one dedicated domain with `vault.`/`auth.` subdomains (matches Privy/Turnkey practice, origin isolation
  only); a separate user-visible auth domain that looks unofficial.
- Limits: no process guarantee on Chrome Android or WebKit. If the auth domain also hosts other Hana sites: no
  domain-wide cookies, restricted DNS zone access.

### D39. Test apps can't sign for mainnet chains
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/core/src/networks.ts`, `packages/web/src/vault/signing.ts`,
  `packages/web/src/client/ethereum.ts`) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q27; decided by the user; how "mainnet" is
  defined: default approved by the user (2026-10-28)
- Decision: the vault refuses mainnet Stellar passphrases and mainnet EVM chain IDs for `pk_test_` apps (keys from the
  testnet MPC). Sodax integrates and tests on chain testnets; real Sodax swaps through Hana wait for the mainnet launch.
- How: Stellar mainnet is the passphrase `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015` (the only one a mainnet
  accepts). EVM uses an **allowlist** of testnet chain IDs (`TEST_EVM_CHAINS`: Sepolia 11155111, Holesky 17000, Base
  Sepolia 84532, Arbitrum Sepolia 421614, OP Sepolia 11155420, Sonic Blaze 57054, BSC testnet 97, Polygon Amoy 80002,
  Avalanche Fuji 43113, local 31337 and 1337; Hoodi 560048 and Sonic testnet 14601 added 2026-10-28, see the
  amendment below); anything else counts as a mainnet. Refused before any popup or policy
  (4100 `mainnet_not_allowed`): transactions and auth entries for those networks, and typed data whose domain
  `chainId` is one. Messages, typed data without a `chainId` and raw requests name no network (D35) and are allowed.
  The EIP-1193 provider refuses `wallet_switchEthereumChain`/`wallet_addEthereumChain` to such a chain and
  `eth_sendTransaction`/`eth_signTransaction` on one. The approval and consent screens of a test app say Hana signs
  only for test networks.
- Rejected: a denylist of known mainnets (a new or unlisted chain would be allowed).
- Amended 2026-10-28 (default decided for the user): test apps can't use raw signing at all.
  `hana_signRaw` from a `pk_test_` app is 4100 `raw_not_allowed_for_test_apps` whatever `raw_sign` says, before any
  API read or popup (`packages/web/src/vault/signing.ts`), because a raw digest can be a mainnet transaction's hash.
  Messages stay allowed. The allowlist gains Ethereum Hoodi 560048 and Sonic testnet 14601 (IDs checked against
  ethereum-lists/chains and each chain's official RPC, `eth_chainId` 0x88bb0 and 0x3909).
- Why: testnet MPC keys can be stolen (weaker operator and node standards) or lost (a network reset changes every
  address), and testnet-derived addresses differ from production ones.
- Rejected: allowing mainnet with warnings and small amounts.
- Open: the mainnet launch date (not set).

### D40. Leaving Hana: per-chain key export and Hana Home, no seed phrase
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user; Hana Home to build before mainnet · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md`
  Q19
- Decision: users leave by exporting each chain's private key (fresh Google sign-in plus typed confirmation). No seed
  phrase, global or per chain, for EVM or Stellar. Before mainnet, Hana runs "Hana Home" on the auth domain: a user
  signs in with Google and can export their keys for any app that uses Hana's shared Google login, so a partner app
  shutting down doesn't strand them. Apps on their own Google client can't be covered (only their origins can get
  tokens for that client).
- Why: private keys import into every major EVM and Stellar wallet (Privy exports keys the same way); a phrase would
  change EVM derivation and add little for these users.
- Rejected: EVM seed phrase export. Deferred (future): a standalone open-source recovery tool that works without
  Hana's servers.

### D41. Key export stays available and mandatory
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user · Source: conversation on lock-in
- Decision: export lives in account settings behind its security checks (fresh Google sign-in, typed confirmation);
  it is never removed, hidden behind support, or switchable off by partners. Retention comes from Hana Home as a
  cross-app destination, features (auto-approve, gas sponsorship, no seed phrase) and partner switching cost
  (addresses come from Hana's contract).
- Why: a working exit underpins the non-custodial claim (get legal advice before mainnet) and partner due diligence.
- Rejected: letting partners disable export (Privy allows it); extra delays or friction beyond the security checks.

### D42. Google client tiers: shared by default, Hana-held branded client for Enterprise
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user; cross-project `sub` test passed (Workspace and personal accounts) · Source:
  `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q3, Q37
- Decision:
  - Standard (default): Hana's shared Google client; Google's screen names Hana. Sodax pilots on this.
  - Enterprise: Hana creates and holds a Google Cloud project and client per partner, branded with the partner's name
    and logo, allowing only Hana's popup pages; registered as the scope's own client. Manual onboarding.
  - Partner-held own client: only if a partner insists, with the client locked down (only Hana's popup pages as
    origins and redirect, no native clients) and a written warning that whoever controls that Google project can
    derive its users' keys.
  - Staging uses its own scope (and test keys), so staging wallet addresses differ from production.
- Why: branding never weakens custody. In Hana the Google token unlocks derivation, so a partner holding the client
  could derive its users' keys silently (unlike Privy, where the token only logs in to Privy). A partner moves from
  Standard to Enterprise with the same addresses, since the path has no client ID.
- Condition, met 2026-10-28: the same Google account through clients in two different Cloud projects got the same
  `sub` (`apps/smoke/spike.html` `subFingerprint`; `docs/context.md` spike notes).

### D43. Session lengths: 12 h absolute, 2 h idle by default
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q5
- Decision: defaults stay 12 h absolute and 2 h idle; partners tune both within the allowed range (≤ 23 h 50 min
  absolute) through app settings. Review after a month of pilot data (logout frequency, re-login cost ≈ 9 s and
  $0.021 each).

### D44. Consent screen: partner names labelled, Hana-verified names marked
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user; in force · Source:
  `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q41
- Decision: the auto-approve consent screen shows a policy's contract names as "named by {app}" with the short address
  and an explorer link. Contracts on Hana's verified list (per chain address → name, starting with Sodax's contracts)
  show a ✓ and the verified name instead. The list is built into the vault and popup bundles (a code release changes
  it, never D1 or the API), and an entry is added only after Hana confirms the address from the protocol's official
  sources.
- Why: partner-chosen names can mislead ("USDC", "Uniswap Router"); addresses alone mean nothing to most users.
- Rejected: partner names as-is; addresses only.
- Built: `packages/core/src/verified-contracts.ts` (frozen list keyed by EVM `chainId` + lowercase address or Stellar
  passphrase + exact contract ID; each entry has its name, sources and date added; explorer URL per chain, test
  networks included) and `packages/web/src/auth/render-consent.ts`. A partner name that reads as a verified name or
  mentions a verified protocol on another contract is flagged ("— not the verified …"); check marks are stripped
  from partner names. Initial entries: Sodax mainnet contracts confirmed by both `@sodax/types@2.1.0` and
  docs.sodax.com/developers/deployments/mainnet (Sonic hub contracts; asset manager and bnUSD on 13 EVM spokes and
  Stellar; Connection on Hedera, Kaia and Robinhood Chain). Addresses only one source lists, or where they disagree,
  are left out.

### D45. Granting auto-approve needs no fresh Google sign-in
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q40
- Decision: consent stays a guarded click in the Hana popup, per device, ending with the session. Hana Home (D40) will
  list active consents per device and let the user revoke them from any device. A consent that outlives a session,
  if ever added, needs a fresh sign-in.
- Why: whoever can click Allow can already click Approve on any single request, which is more powerful than a capped
  consent; a fresh sign-in would add ~9 s and $0.021 for little protection.

### D46. No token amount caps in auto-approve for the pilot
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed by the user · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q39
- Decision: policies limit counts, native value plus fees, recipients (address rule) and contracts/functions; token
  amounts aren't capped. Revisit with the Sodax decoder, which can cap per token per day once it decodes token and
  amount.
- Why: in batch B Sodax swaps and bridges always use the popup; `approve` to an unlisted spender is refused; auto-approve
  is off by default, delayed 24 h and needs user consent.
- Rejected for now: per-token caps from generic `transfer`/`approve`/swap decoding.

## Defaults approved by the user, 2026-10-28

Each entry below is a default the user approved on 2026-10-28 (source: conversation, "default approved by the user").
The matching question in `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Open questions" points here.

### D47. Batch B reconciliations R1–R13 and the remaining batch B decisions confirmed (Q30)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Reconciled conflicts",
  "Decisions (2026-10-27/28)"
- Decision: R1–R13 stand as the spec takes them (two origins; relay-only, end-to-end encrypted token return; vault page
  inlines D1 config and reads `GET /v1/app` lazily; BLS key `a` made after the token arrives; server share plus one
  AES-GCM layer; `max_uses` 1 / 2 / 1; PRK only; export by a fresh login; logout without a transaction; the
  `{v:1,t}` envelope; the encrypted relay plus a defence-in-depth RS256 check; `revoke-all` only within 5 min of a
  fresh login; each tab unlocks itself). Also confirmed as built: the vault iframe plus Hana popups on two origins,
  the token returned only through the encrypted relay, the Google implicit flow, the pinned `signer`/`relayer`/CKD
  key, the vault computing the path, storage partitioning accepted as per-partner isolation, and dev-only privileges
  tied to the env name.

### D48. No silent `app_signed` raw signing in the MVP (Q31)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`raw_sign` is `'off'` or `'approval'` only) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q31
- Decision: raw signing is off or needs an Approve every time. If it comes back, only as requests signed by a
  per-app partner backend key, registered through batch C's fresh-sign-in, logged, notified and delayed process.
- Why: as first specified it was silent signing of chain-valid hashes, controlled by a D1 column.

### D49. A new login supersedes a pending one (Q34)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/vault/vault.ts` `newPending`) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q34
- Decision: `hana_login` while a login is pending ends the old one with `login_cancelled` instead of answering `busy`.

### D50. No local `K_l` wrapping layer (Q35)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (the record holds PRK under `K_s` only) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q35
- Why: it stops no named attacker: whoever can read the record and call the API already gets `K_s`.

### D51. Test and live apps never share a scope (Q37)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`scope_conflict`, `apps/api/src/apps.ts`) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q37,
  the "Proposed, not yet confirmed" list
- Decision: loopback origins and partner-origin session endpoints only in `local*`/`sandbox*` envs, and a `pk_test_`
  app on a scope a `pk_live_` app uses is refused. A partner's staging uses its own scope, so different addresses.

### D52. Enabling raw signing uses the origin-change delay (Q38)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force for raw signing (24 h, `changeDelayMs` in dev envs); batch C reuses it ·
  Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q38
- Decision: `raw_sign = 'approval'` waits the same 24 h as an origin change (D34); batch C's dashboard puts both
  through the same delayed, logged and notified path. Turning it off is immediate (D68).

### D53. `max_uses = 1` in `'session'` mode (Q14)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/vault/login.ts`) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q14, R6
- Decision: `ckd_failed` or a replayed combined call means a new login. No spare use burnt with `revoke_session`.
- Why: the share precondition ("the session is used up") stays simple; measure the MPC failure rate in the pilot.

### D54. `VAULT_KEK` stays a Worker secret with its copy in `.secrets`; KMS later (Q16)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`scripts/vault-kek.ts` `init`/`rotate`, `VAULT_KEK_PREVIOUS`, the cron re-wrap)
  · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q16
- Decision: rotation through `vault-kek rotate`; an HSM/KMS move is revisited with the email issuer (D17).

### D55. The vault zeroes PRK after an in-memory idle period (Q28)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/vault/vault.ts` `goIdle`, `wake`) ·
  Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q28
- Decision: after the app's `idle_ttl_ms` with no request from the partner page (signing, status, addresses, export,
  auto-approve), PRK is zeroed, not only at the absolute end. In `'session'` mode the next request that needs the key
  unlocks the record again (one API call, same share only), which works while the server share is alive; otherwise,
  and in `'none'` mode, the session ends (`sessionExpired`).
- Why: shortens how long PRK sits in a tab nobody uses, where a renderer bug could reach it (security.md (j)).
- Amended 2026-10-28 (default decided for the user): only requests that use the key count as
  activity (the sign methods, `hana_export`, `hana_revokeOtherDevices`, `hana_requestAutoApprove`). `hana_status`,
  `eth_accounts`, `stellar_getAddress` and `hana_autoApproveStatus` don't, and they keep answering while the session
  is dormant without unlocking it, so a page that polls them can't keep PRK in memory. `hana_autoApproveStatus` would
  need PRK to open the consent in the record (it is sealed under a PRK-derived key), so a dormant session answers it
  from this tab's last known consent (not secret: policy id, end time, counters); its counters can lag auto-signs made
  in other tabs until the next request that uses the key.

### D56. The vault checks its scope against the on-chain registry at login (Q7)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/vault/login.ts` `checkScope`) · Source:
  `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q7
- Decision: one view through the manifest RPC, started as soon as `GET /v1/app` answers and awaited before anything
  is relayed: own client `scope_for_client('google', aud)` must be the inlined `scopeId`; shared client
  `get_scope(scopeId)` must exist and allow shared login. Mismatch: `config_mismatch` (`scope_mismatch`); no answer:
  `api_unavailable` (`scope_unchecked`).
- Cost: it runs while the user is at Google, so it adds no time to a normal login (estimated 0 ms waited; the view
  itself is one optimistic `query`, ~0.1–0.3 s on testnet RPC). pk_test_ logins report `timings.scopeCheck` (the
  view) and `timings.scopeWait` (time the login actually waited on it), to measure on testnet.
- Limit: the app→scope binding lives only in D1, so an API that names another scope together with that scope's own
  client passes.

### D57. Keep `create_session` (Q12)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (contract method kept; relayed only for the split fallback and `apps/smoke`) ·
  Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q12
- Decision: `create_session` stays a public method, not removed before the audit.

### D58. CODEOWNERS on derivation, vectors, the contract and the env schema (Q23)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`.github/CODEOWNERS`; needs "Require review from Code Owners" on `develop` and
  `main`) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q23
- Decision: `@tzechuen` owns `packages/core/src/derivation*`, `packages/core/test/vectors/`, `contracts/hana-signer/`
  and `packages/env/src/`.

### D59. Key export: only from a Hana window, relayer-paid, rate-limited per user (Q18)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`apps/api/src/login.ts`) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q18
- Decision: a partner page can only ask (`hana_export` shows the vault's launcher); the export window opens only from
  that click and takes its context only from the vault that opened it. Its `/v1/login` is relayed at Hana's cost and
  limited to 3 per hour per `(app, sha256(path))`, counted after the token check and before the relay.

### D60. Two Google sign-ins are acceptable for a `key_index` move (Q20)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: confirmed (rotation not built) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q20
- Decision: a k → k+1 sweep needs one sign-in per `key_index`; no contract change to derive two indices per session.

### D61. Account 0 only in the MVP UI (Q21)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (the vault signs and derives addresses with account 0 only, `signing.ts`
  `ACCOUNT`; the export window exports account 0; no port method takes an account) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q21
- Decision: `account > 0` stays unused until there is a discovery story.

### D62. A removed policy stops auto-signing within 10 s
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`POLICY_FRESH_MS`, `packages/web/src/vault/vault.ts`) · Source: `docs/security.md`
  "Auto-approve policies"
- Decision: an open vault auto-signs only under a policy `GET /v1/app` confirmed less than 10 s ago.

### D63. Permit2 and Uniswap v3 calls need a protocol decoder
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (the `uint160` rule of D37) · Source: D37, `docs/security.md` (d)
- Decision: their `uint160` fields keep them out of auto-approve until a decoder covers them; the popup handles them.

### D64. The BLS precheck stays off unless measured cheap (Q8)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`BLS_PRECHECK = "0"` in every env) · Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q8
- Decision: turned on only if a measurement shows its Worker CPU cost is acceptable (Workers Paid plan); the MPC
  refuses a bad key anyway.

### D65. Optional `rpcFallback` for the vault's NEAR reads (Q9)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/env/src/schema.ts`, `packages/web/src/near-call.ts`) ·
  Source: `docs/batch-b-spec.md` Q9
- Decision: the manifest may name a second https NEAR RPC. The vault and the export window read from it only when the
  primary errors or times out (8 s), for `get_session` re-syncs, registry views and tx polling; each read's answer
  comes from one endpoint, never a mix. It joins `rpc` in the pages' CSP.
- Amended 2026-10-28 (decided for the user): sandbox-dev's `rpcFallback` is
  `https://rpc.testnet.near.org` (probed: 200, ~3.5 s); the primary stays `test.rpc.fastnear.com`. Takes effect on the
  next `gen`, page build and deploy.

### D66. One thin Worker per Hana origin (R19)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`apps/api/scripts/pages-wrangler.ts`, `apps/api/src/pages/`) · Source: review
  finding R19 (moved from "Proposed")
- Decision: every env serves `vaultOrigin` and `authOrigin` from one thin Worker each (`workers.dev` in dev envs,
  Custom Domains in production), not from routes on the API Worker, so neither origin can serve the other's files.
  Production runs three Workers.

### D67. The Sodax Stellar adapter signs as `rawTx.from` only (R51)
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/sodax/src/stellar.ts`) · Source: review finding R51; the
  "Superseded or amended" row below
- Decision: `signAndSendTransaction(p)` signs with `{address: p.from}`, so a raw transaction built for another account
  (a muxed `M…` address included) is 4100 before any popup.

### D68. Raw signing `'off'` takes effect in open tabs
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`GET /v1/app` `rawSign`; `packages/web/src/vault/vault.ts`
  `freshRawSign`) · Source: `docs/security.md` "Auto-approve policies"
- Decision: the vault re-reads `rawSign` before every raw request on the same 10 s bound as the policy; `'off'`
  refuses until a reload, and a failed re-read refuses (fails closed).

### D69. An EVM policy rule needs `maxValueWei ≥ maxFeeWei`
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`packages/core/src/policy/validate.ts`) · Source:
  `docs/security.md` (b)
- Decision: the validator refuses a rule whose `maxValueWei` is below its `maxFeeWei` (value plus fees counts
  against it since D37, so it could never auto-approve at its fee cap). The consent screen labels the limits
  "Maximum value plus network fees, per transaction / per day".

### D70. No cookies on Hana origins
- Date 2026-10-28 · Status: in force (`apps/api/src/pages/host.ts` `withoutCookies`; tests in apps/api, packages/web
  and the Playwright suite) · Source: D38 ("no domain-wide cookies")
- Decision: no response from the vault origin, the auth origin or the API sets a cookie; the page Workers drop one a
  binding returns.

### D71. SDK packages ship as built ESM with their envs built in
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: in force (`packages/*/tsconfig.build.json`, `scripts/lib/sdk-build.ts`,
  `scripts/pack-check.ts`; CI job `packages`) · Source: Sodax needs to install the SDK outside this monorepo
- Decision: `@hana-id/core`, `web`, `react` and `sodax` build with `tsc` (no bundler, no new dependency) to ESM,
  `.d.ts` and source maps with inlined sources (web into `dist/lib`, since `dist/pages` is the page build). The
  workspace keeps `exports` at `src/`; `pnpm pack` swaps in `publishConfig.exports` and rewrites `workspace:^` to
  `^<version>`. `@hana-id/web` carries exactly the `envs/*.json` that set both Hana origins (today `sandbox-dev`);
  its package build fails on an UNSET value, on a local (loopback) env, or on no env. Partners pick one with
  `createHana({ environment })`. Every change is checked by packing, installing with npm into a project outside the
  workspace, type-checking and importing in Node.
- Rejected: tsup or another bundler (not in the lockfile, and per-file output keeps `sideEffects: false` tree-shaking
  and readable stack traces); a runtime env config (would let a page point the client at another vault).

### D72. One lockstep SDK version, set by script; no Changesets
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: in force (`scripts/sdk-version.ts`, `.github/workflows/publish-sdk.yml`) · Source: SDK
  packaging (D71)
- Decision: the four packages share one version (`0.1.0` first), set with `pnpm --filter @hana-id/scripts
  sdk-version <v>`, which also updates the `VERSION` constants (web's goes to the vault as `sdk`). Publishing is a
  manual-dispatch workflow from `main` with npm provenance, inert until an `NPM_TOKEN` secret exists and the packages
  drop `"private": true`. Not decided: the registry (public npm under an `@hana-id` org, or private) and the licence
  (`UNLICENSED` until then).
- Rejected for now: Changesets. With four packages always released together and one consumer, per-package bump
  files add a dependency tree and a review step without information, and it wouldn't update the `VERSION` constants.
  Revisit if the packages start versioning independently.
### D73. Usage and billing ledger on Neon Postgres in Sydney
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: confirmed by the user, for batch C · Source: `docs/batch-c-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user"
- Decision: the usage and billing ledger (batch C's `USAGE_DB`) is a Neon Postgres project in `aws-ap-southeast-2`
  (Sydney), reached from Workers through Cloudflare Hyperdrive. Hot app config and console data stay in D1.
- Why: the ledger only grows and must be kept for years (D1 caps a database at 10 GB); reports need percentiles,
  time buckets and materialised views; staff and finance can use standard SQL tools; point-in-time restore is
  included. Sydney because the company is incorporated there (Privacy Act cross-border rules) and a team member is
  there. Neon over Supabase: plain Postgres with no auto-exposed data API to lock down, usage-based pricing, branching
  and restore included.
- Rejected: D1 for the ledger (fine for the pilot, but rollups and archiving would be needed); Supabase (its login,
  storage and data API go unused and add attack surface).

### D74. Files on Cloudflare R2
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: confirmed by the user, for batch C · Source: `docs/batch-c-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user"
- Decision: partner logos, monthly statements and ledger exports live in R2 in the Hana Cloudflare account. Logos are
  served from a Hana origin with strict headers; Hana never shows a partner-hosted image in its popups.
- Rejected: Supabase Storage (a second place to secure for no gain).

### D75. Three sign-in audiences; no third-party auth service
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: confirmed by the user, for batch C · Source: `docs/batch-c-spec.md` "Confirmed by the user"
- Decision: wallet users sign in with Google in Hana's popup, verified on chain. Partners use the console's own Google
  OIDC code flow (PKCE), invite-only, owner/viewer roles, server sessions stored as hashes, and a fresh sign-in bound
  to each security-critical change. Hana staff reach the admin console through Cloudflare Access (members of a
  `Hana-Technology` GitHub team with org 2FA required; exact-email Google rules as fallback), and the admin Worker
  verifies the Access JWT on every request.
- Why: the Google ID token is the on-chain owner proof, so an auth service in between adds a party that could
  impersonate partner owners while we still handle Google's token; Access keeps the admin console off the internet and
  hands MFA and offboarding to GitHub/Google.
- Rejected: Supabase Auth (used for Wend's admin portal), Clerk, Auth0, WorkOS; Access for partners (no self-service
  invites, branding or on-chain proofs; per-seat cost past 50 users).

### D76. Keep the one-transaction login (ship gate passed)
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: confirmed by measurement under the rule set in D26 · Source: `docs/context.md` "Login
  timings with stage breakdown"
- Decision: `create_session_and_derive` stays. Over 10 interleaved runs each, it saved 2.44 s of chain time at the
  median against `create_session` + `derive_key`, above the 1.5 s bar.

### D77. The login popup makes no API call; it trusts the vault's app facts
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/auth/login-page.ts`; `/login` CSP without `connect-src`,
  `packages/web/src/auth/pages.ts`, `apps/api/src/pages/host.ts`) · Source: `docs/context.md` "Login timings with
  stage breakdown" (`authCheck` 1.05 s); reasoning in `docs/security.md` "The login popup trusts the vault's app facts"
- Decision: `/login` no longer calls `GET /v1/app` before going to Google. It uses the app name, parent origin, scope
  and Google client from `hana:auth-params`, which it accepts only from the authenticated preparer (the vault on
  `vaultOrigin` by `event.origin` and `event.source`, or `/export` on `authOrigin`), and still checks the pinned
  `SIGNER` and recomputes the nonce. Its CSP drops `connect-src` (it fetches nothing).
- Why: its own read added nothing a malicious party could not already get around. A compromised `vaultOrigin` or API
  Worker already has every key (`docs/security.md` "What a compromise gives"), and the popup's read went to the same
  API. The only things it caught were a vault config gone stale since the page loaded (app suspended, origin removed,
  Google client changed), and `POST /v1/login` refuses all of those anyway before anything is relayed (app gate on the
  current D1 row, `x-hana-parent-origin`, `checkClientScope`, the contract's scope check, the vault's registry check
  D56). So such a login now fails after Google rather than before it. Measured cost removed: about 1.05 s per login.
- Rejected: keeping the read but running it in parallel (the popup navigates to Google at once, which cancels it, and
  moving it to the callback would put it back on the critical path for no added check).

### D78. The vault endpoints cache the app per isolate for 30 s; the share limit runs alongside the gate's
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: in force (`apps/api/src/app-cache.ts`, `apps/api/src/vault/endpoints.ts` `vaultApp`,
  `vaultLimits`; `RateLimiter.refund`) · Source: `docs/context.md` "Login timings with stage breakdown" (unlock gate
  0.24 s)
- Decision: `/v1/vault/*` reads the app (`getAppByKey`, two D1 queries) from an in-isolate cache whose entries live
  30 s from the D1 read (at most 256 apps; unknown keys and failed reads never cached). Nothing in the Worker writes
  `apps`, so the bound is the TTL: a suspension, a removed or changed publishable key, a removed origin, a scope
  conflict or a plan change reaches the vault endpoints within 30 s per isolate. The relay endpoints, `GET /v1/app`
  and the vault page still read D1 every time, so a suspension stops logins (gas) and new vault loads at once. Rate
  limits keep their order and counts: the IP window, then the app window only once the IP window accepted (so a
  request the IP refuses never holds any of the app's shared quota); the share window (`share:<id>`, 10/min) is asked
  alongside them and refunded when the IP or app window refuses, so it counts exactly as before.
- Why: a reload's unlock paid the D1 reads and three limiter round trips one after another; a warm unlock now pays two
  limiter round trips. Suspension and key removal are operator actions where 30 s is acceptable; nothing on the vault
  endpoints spends gas.
- Rejected: asking the IP and app windows in parallel with a refund (a client the IP window refuses would hold app
  quota while its requests are in flight, so one client with many requests open could lock out every user); caching
  for the relay endpoints (a suspension must stop spending at once); an invalidation signal (no Worker code changes
  apps today; revisit with batch C's console).

### D79. Login success is reported before the share is made
- Date 2026-10-29 · Status: in force (`packages/web/src/vault/vault.ts` `finishLogin`, `persistLogin`) · Source:
  `docs/context.md` "Login timings with stage breakdown" (`persist` 0.48 s); amends `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Login"
  steps 11–12
- Decision: in `'session'` mode the vault replies to `hana_login` (and emits `accountsChanged`) as soon as PRK and the
  addresses exist, with `persistence: 'session'`, then makes the share (`POST /v1/vault/shares`, tried once more after
  1 s) and the IndexedDB record in the background. If that gives up, the session keeps working in memory,
  `hana_status` reports `persistence: 'none'` and the vault emits `persistenceChanged {persistence: 'none'}` (the
  client's `hana.persistence` and `useHana()` follow), the share (if made) is revoked, the older session's record this login
  replaces is deleted and its share revoked (the next reload is a full login), and the vault logs a reason code
  (`console.warn`, no ids or keys). A session that ends first (logout, a newer login, expiry, idle, a revocation)
  cancels it: no record is left and a share made for it is revoked; logout doesn't wait. Revoke-other-devices, touch
  and every consent read or write wait for it to settle.
- Why: about 0.48 s off every login, and the share only matters at the next page load.
- Given up: a reload within that window (about one API round trip after the login reply) is a full login; the login
  result's `persistence` is the mode intended, and `persistenceChanged` / `hana_status` say if it didn't happen. Share timings are no
  longer in the login's timings (`persist`, `shareRtt`, `shareServer*` removed); the API's request log still has them.

## Proposed, not yet confirmed

Still open in `docs/batch-b-spec.md` "Open questions": Q2 (near-zero-click returning login), Q4 (partitioned IndexedDB
retention, to measure), Q6 (a "remember this device" option), Q10 (the ship gate's 1.5 s threshold), Q11 (the real
MPC's timeout and failure behaviour), Q13 (dropping partner-origin CORS for `pk_test_` in sandbox envs), Q15 (the
production domain names and Cloudflare account; only "two registrable domains" is decided, D38), Q17 (approval popup
lifetime and mobile behaviour), Q24 (mobile and in-app webviews), Q25 (SWK 1.9.x and 2.x), Q26 (the EIP-6963 `rdns`,
after Q15), Q29 (runtime dependencies and bundle budget). Also open: D33's delay length and the mainnet launch date
(D39). Every decision in `docs/batch-c-spec.md` beyond D28–D32 and D34 is a draft.
